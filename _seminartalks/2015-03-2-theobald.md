Polyhedra (or in the bounded cases polytopes) are the
feasible regions of linear programs. Generalizing this
notion, spectrahedra are defined as the feasible regions
of semidefinite programs.
In this talk, we first provide some general insights into
the emerging world of spectrahedra. Then we study the
computational question whether a given polytope or spectrahedron
$$S_A$$ (as given by the positive semidefiniteness region
of a linear matrix pencil $$A(x)$$) is contained in another
one $$S_B$$.

(Joint work with Kai Kellner and Christian Trabandt.)
